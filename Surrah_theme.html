  <h3>سورة الفاتحة</h3>
  <p>Surah Al-Fatiha, often referred to as “The Opening Chapter”, is fundamental in Islamic worship. It serves as a cornerstone in daily prayers. This Surah is a heartfelt expression of praise to God and a plea for His guidance. The Surah is both a Du’a (prayer) and an introduction of the Qur’an.  It teaches the basic principles of Islamic faith. All praise and thanks are for Allah who is the Lord of all the worlds. Allah is most merciful and most compassionate. Allah is also the Master of the Day of Judgment.  We should pray to Allah only and we should seek His help.  We seek His guidance and help to walk on the straight path.  This is the path of those who received Allah’s favors, not the path of those who incurred His anger or who went astray. <br> <br>
